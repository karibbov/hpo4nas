# HPO for NAS
Repository for the deep learning project.

The aim of this project is to find answers and solutions to the following 
questions and tasks related to Hyper Parameter Optimization (HPO) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS).

**How well can traditional HPO optimizers
like SMAC perform for NAS. Can we identify
under what conditions and properties it can
outperform other methods provided by NASLib?**

**Main Task:
Identify where HPO based NAS
is strongest, using SMAC on the
NASBench201 search space
for CIFAR10.
Use DeepCave to analyse and
Highlight these strengths.**

*Other questions occuring during the project will also be discussed.*
